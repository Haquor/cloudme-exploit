## About the software

Just a quick PoC to go along with YouTube [demonstration](https://youtu.be/7AcmeiFNfiQ).

Crafting a buffer overflow exploit is way easier than it looks. In this video, I'll show you how to write an exploit for stack-based buffer overflow using the JMP ESP instruction.
Using a vulnerable CloudMe executable and Immunity Debugger we can hijack the program flow to run our custom shellcode.

Required Software
  - Python (IDLE, python 2.7)
  - Metasploit Framework
  - Dynamic Analyzer (Debugger): Immunity on Windows, gdb on linux

Target
    - [CloudMe Sync 1.7.1](https://cloudme.en.uptodown.com/windows/download/50719)

To check if file has DEP/ALSR/SafeSEH enabled on Windows use [Get-PESecurity Powershell script](https://github.com/NetSPI/PESecurity)
